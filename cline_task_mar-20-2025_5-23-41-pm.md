```

### **2. TypeScript PWA Styleguide**

**Core Principles**:
1. **Strict Type Safety**:
   ```ts
   interface GameConfig {
     duration: number;
     targetSize: number;
     positions: [number, number][];
   }
   
   const config: GameConfig = JSON.parse(
     import.meta.env.VITE_GAME_CONFIG
   );
   ```

2. **PWA Optimization**:
   ```ts
   // vite.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       VitePWA({
         strategies: 'injectManifest',
         srcDir: 'src',
         filename: 'service-worker.ts',
       })
     ]
   });
   ```

3. **Mobile-First Testing**:
   ```ts
   // playwright.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     use: {
       /* Configure from .env */
       viewport: {
         width: Number(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH),
         height: Number(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT)
       },
       deviceScaleFactor: 2,
       isMobile: true
     }
   });
   ```

### **3. Environment Configuration**

**.env Standard**:
```env
# Game Configuration
VITE_GAME_DURATION=30
VITE_TARGET_SIZE=60
VITE_ANIMATION_DURATION=150

# Playwright Mobile Testing
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=375  # iPhone 12/13
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=812
PLAYWRIGHT_DEVICE="iPhone 13 Pro"
```

**Type-Safe Access**:
```ts
// src/utils/env.ts
export const getConfig = (key: string): string => {
  const value = import.meta.env[key];
  if (!value) throw new Error(`Missing env var: ${key}`);
  return value;
};
```

### **4. Phase Implementation Guides**

**development-phase.md**:
```markdown
## Mobile Interaction Checklist

1. Touch Event Handling:
   ```tsx
   const handleTouch: TouchEventHandler = (e) => {
     e.preventDefault();
     setScore(prev => prev + 1);
     requestAnimationFrame(moveTarget);
   };
   ```

2. Viewport Meta:
   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" 
         content="width=device-width, 
                  initial-scale=1.0,
                  maximum-scale=1.0,
                  user-scalable=no" />
   ```
```

**testing-phase.md**:

## E2E Test Matrix

| Scenario              | Playwright Config          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| iOS Portrait          | iPhone 13 Pro, headless    |
| Android Landscape     | Pixel 5, viewport 850x400  | 
| Tablet                | iPad Pro 12.9               |
```

### **5. Performance & Security**

**Critical Rendering Path**:
```ts
// Preload game assets
<link rel="preload" href="/sounds/tap.mp3" as="audio" />

// Dynamic import for non-critical components
const Settings = React.lazy(() => import('./Settings'));
```

**Service Worker Strategy**:
```ts
// service-worker.ts
precacheAndRoute([
  { url: '/', revision: 'v1' },
  { url: '/app-shell', revision: 'v1' },
  { url: '/manifest.json', revision: 'v1' }
]);
```

### **6. Code Quality Enforcement**

**.clinerules**:
```yaml
rules:
  max-params: 3
  max-depth: 4
  no-nested-ternary: error
  type-annotations: required
```

**Pre-commit Hooks**:
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged && npm run test:changed"
    }
  }

**User:**

[ask_followup_question for 'What are the specific requirements for the game's environment configuration?'] Result:
<answer>
The **Speed Tap Challenge** game requires a well-structured **environment configuration** to ensure flexibility, maintainability, and security. Below are the **specific requirements** for the game's environment configuration:

---

### **1. Centralized Configuration**

**Requirement**: All configuration values must be stored in a single `.env` file, which serves as the **source of truth** for both the application and testing environments.

**Implementation**:
- Use **Vite's environment variable support** to load `.env` variables.
- Prefix all environment variables with `VITE_` to make them accessible in the frontend code.
- Use a `.env.example` file to document all required variables for development.

**Example `.env` File**:
```env
# Game Configuration
VITE_GAME_DURATION=30
VITE_TARGET_SIZE=50
VITE_ANIMATION_DURATION=150

# API Configuration
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info

# Playwright Configuration
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=375
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=667
PLAYWRIGHT_DEVICE_NAME="iPhone 13 Pro"
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true
PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=30000
```

---

### **2. Type Safety**

**Requirement**: Ensure all environment variables are **type-safe** and validated at runtime.

**Implementation**:
- Use a **TypeScript interface** to define the expected shape of environment variables.
- Validate environment variables during application startup to prevent runtime errors.

**Example Validation**:
```ts
interface EnvVariables {
  VITE_GAME_DURATION: number;
  VITE_TARGET_SIZE: number;
  VITE_API_ENDPOINT: string;
}

const env: EnvVariables = {
  VITE_GAME_DURATION: Number(import.meta.env.VITE_GAME_DURATION),
  VITE_TARGET_SIZE: Number(import.meta.env.VITE_TARGET_SIZE),
  VITE_API_ENDPOINT: import.meta.env.VITE_API_ENDPOINT,
};

if (!env.VITE_GAME_DURATION || !env.VITE_TARGET_SIZE || !env.VITE_API_ENDPOINT) {
  throw new Error('Missing required environment variables');
}
```

---

### **3. Separation of Concerns**

**Requirement**: Separate **application configuration** from **testing configuration**.

**Implementation**:
- Use a dedicated `.env.test` file for testing-specific variables.
- Use **Playwright's configuration file** to load testing variables.

**Example `.env.test` File**:
```env
# Testing Configuration
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=375
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=667
PLAYWRIGHT_DEVICE_NAME="iPhone 13 Pro"
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true
PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=30000
```

**Playwright Configuration**:
```ts
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config({ path: '.env.test' });

export default defineConfig({
  use: {
    baseURL: process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL,
    viewport: {
      width: Number(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH),
      height: Number(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT),
    },
    deviceScaleFactor: 2,
    isMobile: true,
  },
});
```

---

### **4. Security**

**Requirement**: Never hardcode sensitive or configuration values in the codebase.

**Implementation**:
- Store all configuration values in `.env` files.
- Add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data.
- Use `.env.example` to document required variables without exposing actual values.

**Example `.gitignore` Entry**:
```gitignore
# Ignore environment files
.env
.env*.local
```

---

### **5. Documentation**

**Requirement**: Provide clear documentation for all environment variables.

**Implementation**:
- Include a **README.md** section explaining how to set up and use environment variables.
- Use `.env.example` to list all required variables with descriptions.

**Example `.env.example` Documentation**:
```env
# Game Configuration
VITE_GAME_DURATION=30        # Duration of the game in seconds
VITE_TARGET_SIZE=50          # Size of the target in pixels
VITE_ANIMATION_DURATION=150  # Duration of animations in milliseconds

# API Configuration
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=https://api.example.com  # API endpoint for leaderboard or other features
VITE_LOG_LEVEL=info                        # Logging level (e.g., info, debug, error)

# Playwright Configuration
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000  # Base URL for Playwright tests
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=375              # Viewport width for mobile testing
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=667             # Viewport height for mobile testing
PLAYWRIGHT_DEVICE_NAME="iPhone 13 Pro"     # Device name for Playwright emulation
PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=true                   # Run tests in headless mode
PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=30000                   # Timeout for Playwright tests in milliseconds
```

---

### **6. Fallback Values**

**Requirement**: Provide sensible default values for optional environment variables.

**Implementation**:
- Use fallback values in the code if an environment variable is not set.
- Log warnings when fallback values are used.

**Example Fallback Implementation**:
```ts
const GAME_DURATION = Number(import.meta.env.VITE_GAME_DURATION) || 30;
const TARGET_SIZE = Number(import.meta.env.VITE_TARGET_SIZE) || 50;

if (!import.meta.env.VITE_GAME_DURATION) {
  console.warn('VITE_GAME_DURATION not set, using default value: 30');
}
```

---

### **7. Testing Environment Variables**

**Requirement**: Ensure environment variables are correctly loaded and used in tests.

**Implementation**:
- Use **Jest's setup files** to load environment variables for unit tests.
- Use **Playwright's configuration** to load environment variables for E2E tests.

**Example Jest Setup**:
```ts
// jest.setup.ts
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config({ path: '.env.test' });
```

---

## TypeScript PWA Styleguide

### Core Principles
1. **Strict Type Safety**:
   ```ts
   interface GameConfig {
     duration: number;
     targetSize: number;
     positions: [number, number][];
   }

   const config: GameConfig = JSON.parse(
     import.meta.env.VITE_GAME_CONFIG
   );
   ```

2. **PWA Optimization**:
   ```ts
   // vite.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [
       VitePWA({
         strategies: 'injectManifest',
         srcDir: 'src',
         filename: 'service-worker.ts',
       })
     ]
   });
   ```

3. **Mobile-First Testing**:
   ```ts
   // playwright.config.ts
   export default defineConfig({
     use: {
       /* Configure from .env */
       viewport: {
         width: Number(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH),
         height: Number(process.env.PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT)
       },
       deviceScaleFactor: 2,
       isMobile: true
     }
   });
   ```

## Environment Configuration

### .env Standard
```env
# Game Configuration
VITE_GAME_DURATION=30
VITE_TARGET_SIZE=60
VITE_ANIMATION_DURATION=150

# Playwright Mobile Testing
PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_WIDTH=375  # iPhone 12/13
PLAYWRIGHT_VIEWPORT_HEIGHT=812
PLAYWRIGHT_DEVICE="iPhone 13 Pro"
```

### Type-Safe Access
```ts
// src/utils/env.ts
export const getConfig = (key: string): string => {
  const value = import.meta.env[key];
  if (!value) throw new Error(`Missing env var: ${key}`);
  return value;
};
```

   const handleTouch: TouchEventHandler = (e) => {
     e.preventDefault();
     setScore(prev => prev + 1);
     requestAnimationFrame(moveTarget);
   };
   ```

2. Viewport Meta:
   ```html
   <meta name="viewport"
         content="width=device-width,
                  initial-scale=1.0,
                  maximum-scale=1.0,
                  user-scalable=no" />
   ```
```

## E2E Test Matrix

| Scenario              | Playwright Config          |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| iOS Portrait          | iPhone 13 Pro, headless    |
| Android Landscape     | Pixel 5, viewport 850x400  |
| Tablet                | iPad Pro 12.9               |
```

## Performance & Security

### Critical Rendering Path
```ts
// Preload game assets
<link rel="preload" href="/sounds/tap.mp3" as="audio" />

// Dynamic import for non-critical components
const Settings = React.lazy(() => import('./Settings'));
```

### Service Worker Strategy
```ts
// service-worker.ts
precacheAndRoute([
  { url: '/', revision: 'v1' },
  { url: '/app-shell', revision: 'v1' },
  { url: '/manifest.json', revision: 'v1' }
]);
```

## Code Quality Enforcement

### .clinerules
```yaml
rules:
  max-params: 3
  max-depth: 4
  no-nested-ternary: error
  type-annotations: required
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
```json
{
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "pre-commit": "lint-staged && npm run test:changed"
    }
  }
}
```

# Speed Tap Challenge - Testing Phase

## Unit Testing

### Objective
Validate individual components and game logic in isolation.

### Requirements
1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Achieve **90%+ test coverage** for all game logic and components.
   - Focus on critical paths (e.g., score increment, timer decrement, target movement).

2. **Tools**:
   - Use **Jest** as the testing framework.
   - Use **React Testing Library** for component testing.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Score Logic**:
     - Verify that the score increments correctly on each tap.
     - Ensure the score resets to zero on game restart.
   - **Timer Logic**:
     - Validate that the timer decrements correctly.
     - Ensure the game ends when the timer reaches zero.
   - **Target Movement**:
     - Confirm that the target moves to a new random position after each tap.
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - Test that environment variables (e.g., game duration, target size) are loaded correctly.

### Example Test
```ts
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import GameBoard from './GameBoard';

test('score increments on tap', () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<GameBoard />);
  const target = getByTestId('target');
  const scoreDisplay = getByTestId('score');

  fireEvent.pointerDown(target);
  expect(scoreDisplay.textContent).toBe('1');
});
```

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

### Objective
Simulate real user interactions and validate the game's functionality across devices.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Playwright** for cross-browser and cross-device testing.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Test core user flows (e.g., starting the game, tapping the target, game over).
   - Validate PWA features (e.g., offline mode, installability).

3. **Device Simulation**:
   - Test on multiple devices (e.g., iPhone, Android, tablet) using Playwright's device emulation.
   - Use environment variables to configure viewport sizes and device settings.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - **Game Flow**:
     - Verify that the game starts and ends correctly.
     - Ensure the score updates on each tap.
   - **PWA Features**:
     - Validate service worker registration and offline functionality.
     - Test the web app manifest for correct installation behavior.
   - **Accessibility**:
     - Ensure touch targets are accessible and meet size requirements.
     - Validate keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### Example Test
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('game starts and score updates on tap', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('#start-button');
  await page.click('#target');
  const scoreText = await page.textContent('#score');
  expect(scoreText).toBe('1');
});
```

## Accessibility Testing

### Objective
Ensure the game is usable by all players, including those with disabilities.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **axe** or **Lighthouse** for automated accessibility testing.
   - Conduct manual testing with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Validate touch target sizes (minimum 44x44 pixels).
   - Ensure proper ARIA labels and roles for dynamic elements.
   - Test color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Touch Targets**:
     - Verify that all interactive elements meet size requirements.
   - **Screen Reader Support**:
     - Ensure dynamic elements (e.g., score, timer) are announced correctly.
   - **Keyboard Navigation**:
     - Confirm the game is fully playable using only the keyboard.

### Example Test
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('keyboard navigation works', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.keyboard.press('Enter'); // Start game
  await page.keyboard.press('Space'); // Simulate tap
  const scoreText = await page.textContent('#score');
  expect(scoreText).toBe('1');
});
```

## Performance Testing

### Objective
Ensure the game meets performance benchmarks.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Lighthouse** for performance audits.
   - Use **Playwright** to measure load times and FPS.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Measure **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** and **Time to Interactive (TTI)**.
   - Validate animations run at **60 FPS**.
   - Test memory usage during gameplay.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Load Times**:
     - Ensure FCP is less than **1.5 seconds** on 3G networks.
   - **Animations**:
     - Confirm animations run smoothly without jank.
   - **Memory Usage**:
     - Ensure memory usage remains below **50MB** during gameplay.

### Example Test
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('load time is within limits', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  const loadTime = await page.evaluate(() => window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd - window.performance.timing.navigationStart);
  expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(1500); // 1.5 seconds
});
```

## Cross-Browser Testing

### Objective
Ensure the game works consistently across all major browsers.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Playwright** for cross-browser testing.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Test on **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, and **Edge**.
   - Validate touch and keyboard interactions on each browser.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Game Functionality**:
     - Verify core features (e.g., scoring, timer, target movement) work on all browsers.
   - **PWA Features**:
     - Ensure service worker and web app manifest work consistently.

## Regression Testing

### Objective
Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Jest** and **Playwright** for automated regression tests.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Run all unit and E2E tests on every pull request.
   - Add regression tests for any bugs found during development.

**Assistant:**

The error indicates that there is a syntax issue in the `vite.config.ts` file. Specifically, it seems there is a missing semicolon (`;`) after the `manifest` property.

Let's correct this issue by adding the missing semicolon.

**Assistant:**

It appears that the diff did not apply correctly because the content of the file has changed since the last read. Let's read the latest content of the file and then apply the diff again.

 1 | # Speed Tap Challenge - Initial Planning
 2 | 
 3 | ## Project Purpose
 4 | The purpose of the **Speed Tap Challenge** project is to create a **mobile-responsive Progressive Web App (PWA)** game using **Vite, React, and TypeScript**. The game challenges players to tap a target as many times as possible within a countdown timer, providing an engaging and interactive experience. The project emphasizes **best practices** in modern web development, including:
 5 | 
 6 | 1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth animations and fast load times for mobile devices.
 7 | 2. **PWA Features**: Enabling offline play, installability, and native app-like behavior.
 8 | 3. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript for robust, maintainable, and error-free code.
 9 | 4. **Testing**: Implementing comprehensive unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests using **Jest** and **Playwright**.
10 | 5. **Environment Configuration**: Centralizing all configuration values (e.g., game duration, target size, testing parameters) in a single `.env` file for maintainability and flexibility.
11 | 6. **Mobile-First Design**: Prioritizing responsive and accessible design for a seamless experience across devices.
12 | 
13 | ### Key Objectives
14 | - **Game Mechanics**:
15 |   - Players tap a target to score points.
16 |   - The target moves randomly after each tap.
17 |   - A countdown timer adds urgency and challenge.
18 | - **Technical Excellence**:
19 |   - Use **Vite** for fast development and production builds.
20 |   - Implement **React** for a component-based architecture.
21 |   - Ensure **TypeScript** type safety for all game logic and components.
22 |   - Integrate **PWA** features like service workers and a web app manifest.
23 | - **Testing**:
24 |   - Write unit tests for game logic and components.
25 |   - Use **Playwright** for E2E testing, simulating mobile devices and touch interactions.
26 | - **Scalability**:
27 |   - Design the architecture to allow easy addition of new features (e.g., leaderboards, levels, or multiplayer modes).
28 | 
29 | ### Broader Vision
30 | The project serves as a **template** for building modern, high-performance web applications with a focus on:
31 | - **Maintainability**: Clear folder structure, type safety, and centralized configuration.
32 | - **Extensibility**: Modular design to support future enhancements.
33 | - **Best Practices**: Adherence to industry standards for PWA development, testing, and performance optimization.
34 | 
35 | By combining **game development** with **modern web technologies**, the project demonstrates how to build a fun, interactive experience while adhering to professional engineering standards.

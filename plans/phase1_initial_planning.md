# Speed Tap Challenge - Initial Planning

## Project Purpose
The purpose of the **Speed Tap Challenge** project is to create a **mobile-responsive Progressive Web App (PWA)** game using **Vite, React, and TypeScript**. The game challenges players to tap a target as many times as possible within a countdown timer, providing an engaging and interactive experience. The project emphasizes **best practices** in modern web development, including:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth animations and fast load times for mobile devices.
2. **PWA Features**: Enabling offline play, installability, and native app-like behavior.
3. **Type Safety**: Leveraging TypeScript for robust, maintainable, and error-free code.
4. **Testing**: Implementing comprehensive unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests using **Jest** and **Playwright**.
5. **Environment Configuration**: Centralizing all configuration values (e.g., game duration, target size, testing parameters) in a single `.env` file for maintainability and flexibility.
6. **Mobile-First Design**: Prioritizing responsive and accessible design for a seamless experience across devices.

### Key Objectives
- **Game Mechanics**:
  - Players tap a target to score points.
  - The target moves randomly after each tap.
  - A countdown timer adds urgency and challenge.
- **Technical Excellence**:
  - Use **Vite** for fast development and production builds.
  - Implement **React** for a component-based architecture.
  - Ensure **TypeScript** type safety for all game logic and components.
  - Integrate **PWA** features like service workers and a web app manifest.
- **Testing**:
  - Write unit tests for game logic and components.
  - Use **Playwright** for E2E testing, simulating mobile devices and touch interactions.
- **Scalability**:
  - Design the architecture to allow easy addition of new features (e.g., leaderboards, levels, or multiplayer modes).

### Broader Vision
The project serves as a **template** for building modern, high-performance web applications with a focus on:
- **Maintainability**: Clear folder structure, type safety, and centralized configuration.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design to support future enhancements.
- **Best Practices**: Adherence to industry standards for PWA development, testing, and performance optimization.

By combining **game development** with **modern web technologies**, the project demonstrates how to build a fun, interactive experience while adhering to professional engineering standards.

# Speed Tap Challenge - Testing Phase

## Unit Testing

### Objective
Validate individual components and game logic in isolation.

### Requirements
1. **Test Coverage**:
   - Achieve **90%+ test coverage** for all game logic and components.
   - Focus on critical paths (e.g., score increment, timer decrement, target movement).

2. **Tools**:
   - Use **Jest** as the testing framework.
   - Use **React Testing Library** for component testing.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Score Logic**:
     - Verify that the score increments correctly on each tap.
     - Ensure the score resets to zero on game restart.
   - **Timer Logic**:
     - Validate that the timer decrements correctly.
     - Ensure the game ends when the timer reaches zero.
   - **Target Movement**:
     - Confirm that the target moves to a new random position after each tap.
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - Test that environment variables (e.g., game duration, target size) are loaded correctly.

### Example Test
```ts
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import GameBoard from './GameBoard';

test('score increments on tap', () => {
  const { getByTestId } = render(<GameBoard />);
  const target = getByTestId('target');
  const scoreDisplay = getByTestId('score');

  fireEvent.pointerDown(target);
  expect(scoreDisplay.textContent).toBe('1');
});
```

## End-to-End (E2E) Testing

### Objective
Simulate real user interactions and validate the game's functionality across devices.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Playwright** for cross-browser and cross-device testing.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Test core user flows (e.g., starting the game, tapping the target, game over).
   - Validate PWA features (e.g., offline mode, installability).

3. **Device Simulation**:
   - Test on multiple devices (e.g., iPhone, Android, tablet) using Playwright's device emulation.
   - Use environment variables to configure viewport sizes and device settings.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - **Game Flow**:
     - Verify that the game starts and ends correctly.
     - Ensure the score updates on each tap.
   - **PWA Features**:
     - Validate service worker registration and offline functionality.
     - Test the web app manifest for correct installation behavior.
   - **Accessibility**:
     - Ensure touch targets are accessible and meet size requirements.
     - Validate keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

### Example Test
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('game starts and score updates on tap', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.click('#start-button');
  await page.click('#target');
  const scoreText = await page.textContent('#score');
  expect(scoreText).toBe('1');
});
```

## Accessibility Testing

### Objective
Ensure the game is usable by all players, including those with disabilities.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **axe** or **Lighthouse** for automated accessibility testing.
   - Conduct manual testing with screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Validate touch target sizes (minimum 44x44 pixels).
   - Ensure proper ARIA labels and roles for dynamic elements.
   - Test color contrast ratios (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Touch Targets**:
     - Verify that all interactive elements meet size requirements.
   - **Screen Reader Support**:
     - Ensure dynamic elements (e.g., score, timer) are announced correctly.
   - **Keyboard Navigation**:
     - Confirm the game is fully playable using only the keyboard.

### Example Test
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('keyboard navigation works', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await page.keyboard.press('Enter'); // Start game
  await page.keyboard.press('Space'); // Simulate tap
  const scoreText = await page.textContent('#score');
  expect(scoreText).toBe('1');
});
```

## Performance Testing

### Objective
Ensure the game meets performance benchmarks.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Lighthouse** for performance audits.
   - Use **Playwright** to measure load times and FPS.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Measure **First Contentful Paint (FCP)** and **Time to Interactive (TTI)**.
   - Validate animations run at **60 FPS**.
   - Test memory usage during gameplay.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Load Times**:
     - Ensure FCP is less than **1.5 seconds** on 3G networks.
   - **Animations**:
     - Confirm animations run smoothly without jank.
   - **Memory Usage**:
     - Ensure memory usage remains below **50MB** during gameplay.

### Example Test
```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('load time is within limits', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  const loadTime = await page.evaluate(() => window.performance.timing.loadEventEnd - window.performance.timing.navigationStart);
  expect(loadTime).toBeLessThan(1500); // 1.5 seconds
});
```

## Cross-Browser Testing

### Objective
Ensure the game works consistently across all major browsers.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Playwright** for cross-browser testing.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Test on **Chrome**, **Firefox**, **Safari**, and **Edge**.
   - Validate touch and keyboard interactions on each browser.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - **Game Functionality**:
     - Verify core features (e.g., scoring, timer, target movement) work on all browsers.
   - **PWA Features**:
     - Ensure service worker and web app manifest work consistently.

## Regression Testing

### Objective
Ensure new changes do not break existing functionality.

### Requirements
1. **Tools**:
   - Use **Jest** and **Playwright** for automated regression tests.

2. **Test Coverage**:
   - Run all unit and E2E tests on every pull request.
   - Add regression tests for any bugs found during development.
